# ATM-BANKING-SYSTEM

This code is a basic banking system program that allows the user to create customer accounts, deposit and withdraw money, view balance and transaction history, and verify PINs.

The program uses structures to store customer, account, and transaction details, and global arrays to keep track of the number of customers, accounts, and transactions.

The main function displays a menu of options to the user and calls the appropriate functions based on the user's choice.

The code includes functions to create a new customer and account, deposit money into an account, view the account balance, view the transaction history for an account, and verify the PIN for an account.

Overall, the code is a starting point for a basic banking system, but it lacks several important features, such as error handling, data validation, and security measures. These should be added to ensure the system is robust and secure.
